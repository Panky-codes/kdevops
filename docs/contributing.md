# Contributing to kdevops

We have requested a mailing list dedicated for kdevops on August 3, 2023.
Until then please email patches to the folks in the output of:

git shortlog -sne v5.0.2..

and Cc: patches@lists.linux.dev

You will have to learn to use git format-patch and then git send-email.
Pull requests on the web are ignored.

Commit logs should have a subject and something to describe on the
commit message, even if its a typo. And if you're going to fix one
typo, why not fix a few?

Please use the Signed-off-by tag, the meaning of which is defined in
[CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING)  file.
