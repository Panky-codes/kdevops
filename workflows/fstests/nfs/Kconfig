	  By default we aim to spawn enough hosts to cover testing the full
	  range of supported features upstream on the Linux kernel for nfs,
	  and for you to also be able to do development on each section
	  concurrently. Distributions however may override sensible defaults
	  and only support certain features. Enabling this option lets you
	  select and test only specific configurations.

	  By default we enables all tests, but certain distributions may
	  disable certain features and as such don't need to run certain
	  type of tests.

	  You can enable this to allow you to override the default test
	  coverage.
